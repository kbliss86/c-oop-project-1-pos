# OOP Project

## Overview

The OOP Project is a collaborative effort for bootcamp students to:

- **Apply Key Concepts**: Utilize various topics learned during the course, such as classes, polymorphism, user input, arrays and lists, and exception handling.
- **Tackle a Larger Case Study**: This project is more complex than lab exercises, serving as a precursor to the Final Project.
- **Work in Teams**: Collaborate with teammates to experience proper object-oriented design, documentation, and version control.

## Project Options

Each group must select one of the following projects. Once a project is chosen, no switching is allowed. The minimum requirements for each project are listed below, but groups are encouraged to go beyond these requirements and add additional features of interest.

1. **Point-of-Sale Terminal**  
   A cash register/ordering terminal for a retail location, such as a store, coffee shop, or fast-food restaurant.

2. **Library System**  
   A system to manage the borrowing, returning, and tracking of library materials.

3. **Fitness Center**  
   A management system for members, classes, and facilities in a fitness center.

Please inform your instructors which project your team has chosen and share your GitHub repository link as soon as it’s created.

## Point-of-Sale Terminal

### Project Description

Create a cash register or self-service terminal for a retail environment like a small store, coffee shop, or fast-food restaurant.

### Requirements

- **Product Class**:
  - Must include: 
    - Name
    - Category
    - Description
    - Price
  - Store at least 12 items in a list.
  
- **User Interaction**:
  - Present a menu for the user to choose an item (by number or letter).
  - Allow the user to choose the quantity for each item ordered.
  - Calculate and display the line total (item price × quantity).
  
- **Completion Options**:
  - Option to re-display the menu.
  - Option to complete the purchase.

- **Payment Process**:
  - Display the subtotal, sales tax, and grand total (use the Math library to handle rounding issues).
  - Ask for the payment type:
    - **Cash**: Ask for the amount tendered and provide change.
    - **Check**: Ask for the check number.
    - **Credit**: Ask for the credit card number, expiration, and CVV.

> **Hint**: Use an array or list to keep track of ordered items.

### Optional Enhancements

- **Moderate**: Store the list of products in a text file and provide an option to add new items to the product list, which should then be written to the file.
- **Buff**: Do a push-up each time you encounter an exception or error while running your code!

## Collaboration

This project involves group work, and the majority of class time will be dedicated to it. However, some outside work may be necessary. There will be regular check-ins to ensure that groups are on track.
